# Petstore Service API tests project

> Generated automatically by **e2efast**.

## Overview

This project was scaffolded from the OpenAPI specification for the `petstore` service. The codebase is organised to keep generated artefacts separate from the places where you add custom logic, making it safe to rerun the generator whenever the contract changes.

## Quick Start

1. Run the generator (adjusting service name/spec as needed). The `--spec`
   option accepts either a local file path or an HTTP(S) URL:

   ```bash
   poetry run e2efast petstore --spec ./openapi.json --with-tests
   ```

2. Open `framework/settings/base_settings.py` and update the base URL or any
   other settings you require.

3. Export the environment variables (or ensure they are provided via your
   settings loader) and start writing tests—the generated clients, fixtures, and
   tests will use the configuration automatically.

   On the first run the generator creates `framework/settings/base_settings.py`
   and, when fixtures are enabled, `tests/conftest.py`. Subsequent updates should
   be applied manually.

4. Need only clients and fixtures (without tests)? Run the same command with
   `--with-fixtures` (the `--spec` option still accepts a path or URL):

   ```bash
   poetry run e2efast petstore --spec ./openapi.json --with-fixtures
   ```

```
* **internal** – contains the raw clients and data models produced by `restcodegen`. These files are overwritten on each generation. If you need a technical helper (e.g. custom HTTP adapter or DB-aware client), place it in another module to avoid losing changes.
* **framework/clients/http/petstore** – hosts subclasses of the generated clients. Override methods here to simplify calls or add project-specific behaviour. Files in this folder are **not** overwritten after the first generation.
* **framework/fixtures/http/petstore.py** – pytest fixtures that instantiate the wrapper clients. They provide a single entry point for the HTTP client configuration used inside tests.

## Using the Fixtures

1. Expose the fixtures to pytest by adding the generated module to `pytest_plugins` in your root `conftest.py`:

   ```python
   pytest_plugins = ["framework.fixtures.http.petstore"]
   ```

2. Export the base URL for the service before running tests:

   ```bash
   export PETSTORE_BASE_URL="https://api.example.test"
   ```
   or
   ```python
   # conftest.py
   import os
   os.environ["PETSTORE_BASE_URL"] = "https://api.example.test"
   ```

   The fixtures will reuse this environment variable when creating HTTP clients.

3. If you need to change the HTTP client implementation globally, edit
   `framework/fixtures/http/base.py` and update `ClientClass`. Every generated
   fixture imports that alias and will pick up the override automatically.

4. Initial configuration settings are scaffolded in
   `framework/settings/base_settings.py`. The file is generated only on the
   first run—afterwards you should maintain it manually (for example, to point at
   different hosts or add extra parameters). The expected environment variable
   names follow the pattern `<package_name_upper>_BASE_URL`; you can confirm the
   exact name inside any generated fixture (look for the `os.getenv` call).

## Regeneration Guidelines

- Re-run `e2efast` each time the OpenAPI specification changes. The generator will refresh `internal/` and fixture code while leaving your custom wrappers untouched.
- Keep custom business logic inside the `clients/http/petstore` package or other user-created modules.
- If you introduce additional fixtures, remember to register their module path in `pytest_plugins` as well.
