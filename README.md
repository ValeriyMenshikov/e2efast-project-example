# Petstore Service API tests project

> Generated automatically by **e2efast**.

## Overview

This project was scaffolded from the OpenAPI specification for the `petstore` service. The codebase is organised to keep generated artefacts separate from the places where you add custom logic, making it safe to rerun the generator whenever the contract changes.

## Project Structure

```

* **internal** – contains the raw clients and data models produced by `restcodegen`. These files are overwritten on each generation. If you need a technical helper (e.g. custom HTTP adapter or DB-aware client), place it in another module to avoid losing changes.
* **framework/clients/http/petstore** – hosts subclasses of the generated clients. Override methods here to simplify calls or add project-specific behaviour. Files in this folder are **not** overwritten after the first generation.
* **framework/fixtures/http/petstore.py** – pytest fixtures that instantiate the wrapper clients. They provide a single entry point for the HTTP client configuration used inside tests.

## Using the Fixtures

1. Expose the fixtures to pytest by adding the generated module to `pytest_plugins` in your root `conftest.py`:

   ```python
   pytest_plugins = ["fixtures.http.petstore"]
   ```

2. Export the base URL for the service before running tests:

   ```bash
   export PETSTORE_BASE_URL="https://api.example.test"
   ```

   The fixtures will reuse this environment variable when creating HTTP clients.

## Regeneration Guidelines

- Re-run `e2efast` each time the OpenAPI specification changes. The generator will refresh `internal/` and fixture code while leaving your custom wrappers untouched.
- Keep custom business logic inside the `clients/http/petstore` package or other user-created modules.
- If you introduce additional fixtures, remember to register their module path in `pytest_plugins` as well.
